### Purpose
This is a Python port of the [ORI Advanced Forensic Actions tools](http://ori.hhs.gov/advanced-forensic-actions).

The original version was developed as an Adobe Photoshop CS4-CS5 plugin; this 
port was motivated by a desire to make these tools usable without software 
licensing fees. This port is provided without warranty, and was produced 
without affiliation or endorsement from the Office of Research Integrity or 
original authors.

Some sample data was taken from the description of methods in the affidavit 
of John W. Kruger, [Case No. 14-013099-CZ](http://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014.12.10-PubPeer-Motion-to-Quash-Ex-B-Krueger-Affidavit.pdf). 

### Installation
The user must have Python 2.7 or 3.x installed on their computer. 
Additional dependencies can be installed using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

MS Windows users may need to download precompiled binary versions from the 
relevant project websites.

### Usage
Gradients can be imported for use in python matplotlib. For quick 
experimentation, a browser-based tool is also provided.
